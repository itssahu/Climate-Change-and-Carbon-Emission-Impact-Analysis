Climate Change & Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis
Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the impact of carbon emissions on global temperature anomalies. By exploring historical trends and relationships between CO₂ concentrations and temperature changes, this project aims to provide actionable insights for sustainable policy-making and a deeper understanding of climate dynamics.
Project Description

Climate change remains one of the most critical challenges of our time. Our analysis focuses on how rising carbon emissions are closely linked to global temperature increases. Using robust statistical methods and predictive modeling, we examine:

    Historical Trends: Analysis of long-term temperature changes and CO₂ concentration increases.

    Statistical Relationships: Investigation of correlations and causality between CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies.

    Lagged Effects: Assessment of the impact of previous years' CO₂ levels on current temperature changes.

    Clustering of Climate Patterns: Identification of distinct climate patterns through unsupervised learning.

    What-If Scenarios: Simulation of hypothetical emission changes to predict future temperature responses.

Datasets

The study integrates two primary datasets:

    Temperature Data: Annual temperature anomalies (°C) measured across multiple countries and decades.

    CO₂ Data: Monthly global atmospheric CO₂ concentrations (ppm), reflecting the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Methodology

The analysis proceeds through several key stages:

    Descriptive Statistics: Computation of mean, median, and variance to summarize both temperature and CO₂ datasets.

    Time-Series Analysis: Visualization of trends over time, illustrating a consistent rise in both CO₂ levels and global temperatures.

    Correlation & Causality Testing: Use of Pearson and Spearman correlations alongside Granger Causality tests to quantify and explore the relationship between CO₂ concentrations and temperature changes.

    Lagged Effects Investigation: Creation of lagged variables to evaluate the delayed impact of historical CO₂ levels on current temperature anomalies using regression models.

    Clustering Analysis: Application of K-Means clustering to group years based on similar climate patterns, highlighting distinct phases of low, moderate, and high temperature changes corresponding to varying CO₂ levels.

    Predictive Modeling: Simulation of “what-if” scenarios to forecast temperature changes under various CO₂ concentration adjustments, emphasizing the sensitivity of global temperatures to emission levels.

Key Insights

    Strong Correlation: There is a very strong positive correlation between CO₂ concentrations and temperature changes, reinforcing the role of carbon emissions in driving global warming.

    Rising Emissions vs. Gradual Temperature Increase: Although CO₂ levels are rising at a significantly faster rate, the gradual accumulation of temperature anomalies suggests long-term consequences that may escalate if unchecked.

    Lagged Effects: Current CO₂ levels have the most substantial impact on temperature changes, with diminishing influence from previous years’ emissions.

    Distinct Climate Patterns: Clustering analysis reveals clear segments in the historical climate record, each representing different levels of temperature and CO₂ concentrations.

    Impactful What-If Scenarios: Simulated scenarios demonstrate that even modest changes in CO₂ emissions can lead to significant shifts in temperature anomalies, highlighting the potential for both mitigation and exacerbation of climate change effects.

Conclusion

This analysis underscores the critical need for timely and effective interventions to reduce carbon emissions. By leveraging historical data and predictive models, the project provides compelling evidence of the intertwined nature of CO₂ concentrations and global temperature changes. The insights gained here serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and environmental advocates working towards sustainable solutions for our planet.
